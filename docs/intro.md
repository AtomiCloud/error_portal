# Error Portal

The Error Portal is the Catalog of all structured error emitted by AtomiCloud APIs using the [ProblemDetails RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807). 

Here, the details of each error (the `data` field) will be displayed via `JSON  Schema` with description, and organized by the `LPSM` system with version.

Full Text Search is supported.
